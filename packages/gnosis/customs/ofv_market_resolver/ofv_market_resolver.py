- The market's question needs to be specific, without use of pronouns.
- The market's question needs to have a clear future event.
- The market's question needs to have a clear time frame.
- The event in the market's question doesn't have to be ultra-specific, it will be decided by a crowd later on.
- If the market's question contains date, but without an year, it's okay.
- If the market's question contains year, but without an exact date, it's okay.
- The market's question can not be about itself or refer to itself.
- The answer is probably Google-able, after the event happened.
- The potential asnwer can be only "Yes" or "No".
Follow a chain of thought to evaluate if the question is fully qualified:
First, write the parts of the following question:
"{question}"
Then, write down what is the future event of the question, what it refers to and when that event will happen if the question contains it.
Then, explain why do you think it is or isn't fully qualified.
Finally, write your final decision, write `decision: ` followed by either "yes it is fully qualified" or "no it isn't fully qualified" about the question. Don't write anything else after that. You must include "yes" or "no".
